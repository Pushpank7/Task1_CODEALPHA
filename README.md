# Hangman Game in Python

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. In this Python implementation, we'll create a simple text-based version of the Hangman game.



## TOOLS:

PyCharm: PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for Python development. It provides features such as code highlighting, auto-completion, debugging tools, and project management, which can significantly enhance your coding experience.

Python Interpreter: PyCharm allows you to set up a Python interpreter for your project. You can choose the version of Python you want to use and manage packages and dependencies easily within the IDE.
## Features

1. Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list. You can easily expand this list to include more words.

2. User Input: Players input their guesses, which are single letters. The game validates the input and checks if the letter has already been guessed.

3. Display Progress: The game displays the current state of the word, showing which letters have been guessed and which are still unknown.

4. Limited Guesses: Players have a limited number of guesses before the game ends. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman being drawn.

5. End Game Conditions: The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly, runs out of guesses, or chooses to quit.
## How to use:

- Write the Code: Write the Hangman game code using Python in the Python file you created. You can use the description and guidelines provided earlier in this conversation to implement the game.

- Run the Code: Once you've finished writing the code, run it within PyCharm. You can do this by clicking the "Run" button or pressing the associated shortcut.

- Play the Game: Follow the instructions displayed in the PyCharm console to play the game. The game will prompt you to guess letters to uncover the hidden word. Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly, run out of guesses, or choose to quit.

- Enjoy: Have fun playing the Hangman game and see if you can guess the word before it's too late!
